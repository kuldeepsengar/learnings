- My name is Advait Sengaf and today I want to tell you about my favorite book.
- It’s called **"The Boy Who Loved Everyone"** by Jane Porter.
- I love this book because it is about a boy named Dimitri who is very kind and loving. 
- On his first day at preschool, he tells everyone he loves them.
- I like how Dimitri is not afraid to show his feelings and wants everyone to feel loved.
- Dimitri felt sad when no one said "I love you" back, but his mom showed him that his friends and others were showing love in their own ways, like inviting him to play or giving him a hug.
- I learned that people can show love in many different ways, not just by saying "I love you."
- Sometimes, people show love by being kind, helping, smiling, or giving a hug.

- My favorite character is Dimitri!
- I like him because he is very brave and gentle.
- Even when people didn’t say "I love you" back, he still cared about them.

- Thank you for listening!
